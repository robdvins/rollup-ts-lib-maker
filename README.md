  Congrats!🎉 You found me!🤩 Hopefully this template will save you some time doing a basic and simple setup to start building your next library. (Yes, it took me some time especially if you are not familiar with all the tools used 😝) 
</p>

## Note

> This basic setup is meant for developing libraries (not apps) that can be published to NPM. Obviously depending on what you are going to create you will need to do some extra configuration, but at least you have a base to start from. (Yep, this is tedious! 😫)

## Reminder

> Please do not forget to modify the **package.json**, the **LICENSE** and the file you are reading before publishing to NPM.
